<!-- This ActionView::Helper will create a form for us. It includes an authenticity token which is necessary to submit requests via a form in Rails. We should only use this form_tag helper for forms that aren't going to create or update an instance of one of our models e.g. a user login form -->

  <!-- We can use specific ActionView::Helper methods for each type of input field. The :pet, :name and :pet, :age syntax means that the name and age keys will be placed inside a nested pet hash within params i.e. params => { pet => { name: , age: }}  -->
